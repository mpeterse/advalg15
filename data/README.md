You find here three datasets of varying size.

 * `kaiserslautern.osm.gz` – the whole city of Kaiserslautern, more or less.
 * `kaiserslautern_cc.osm.gz` – Kaiserslautern city center, which is
    significantly smaller but has lots of short street stretches.
 * `kaiserslautern_uni.osm.gz` – university campus and the adjacent residential area,
   a still smaller and also less "dense" area.
 
All data have been pulled from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
project using the [extractor on bbbike.org](http://download.bbbike.org/osm/).
Find information on the data format on the [OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML).
